 GestureSense is a real-time hand gesture recognition system using OpenCV and MediaPipe. It captures and processes video from your camera to detect hand movements, recognizing gestures like open hands and closed fists. This project demonstrates intuitive, touch-free control for various applications.


GestureSense is an innovative hand gesture recognition system that uses computer vision to detect and interpret hand movements in real-time through the built-in camera of your device. Utilizing OpenCV and MediaPipe, the project captures live video frames, processes them to detect hand landmarks, and recognizes gestures such as open hands, closed fists, and more. The system tracks hand movements with precision, enabling gesture-based interactions that can be used for various applications like human-computer interaction, virtual reality, and assistive technology.

GestureSense focuses on making interactions more intuitive and touch-free, offering a hands-on introduction to gesture recognition technology. It can be used for controlling software applications, enhancing accessibility for those with limited mobility, and even for gaming. By leveraging machine learning models embedded in MediaPipe, the project accurately identifies gestures and provides immediate visual feedback, making it an ideal tool for developers and researchers exploring gesture-based controls.

This project demonstrates the practical application of AI in everyday technology, showcasing how gestures can revolutionize user interaction in a world that increasingly values touchless interfaces. GestureSense is a stepping stone toward more advanced systems that could one day replace traditional input methods with seamless, natural interactions.
